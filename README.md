# Dotfiles

These are the configuration of the tools i use a lot. Saved to save work in case of any disaster

## Custom Scripts
I the following scripts on regular basis

### Mute Mic with Ctrl+M
Different meeting platforms have different muting shortcut (because I hate mouse). So I created a small script to mute mic all over the system.
I added a custom key board shortcut to trigger this script which mutes/unmutes microphone.

### Memory Alert
Recently I upgraded my laptop's RAM but before that my poor 8GB ram used to get filled quite easily by my 100 tabs and 10-12 windows opened in the background.
I got irritated as the laptop just used to stuck and I would need to do a hard restart, which not only is harmful for my laptop life but I needed to open back those 100 tabs ðŸ˜¢.

So I created this to alert me whenever my laptops ram went above `85%` (changable easily) with a notification with the program taking maximum amount of memory. If memory usage goes above `95%` (changable easily) it just kills the process which is taking the maximum amount of memory so that it doesn't gets filled 100% and my screen is stuck ðŸ˜„


## Setup Scripts
I created multiple scripts to install the libs and tools I use daily so that I don't have to do all the work and googling again to configure my system to my needs.

## TODO
- [ ] Create a master script to run all setup scripts. (wip).
